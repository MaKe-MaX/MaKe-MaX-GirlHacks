IMPORTANT: add "py -m" before pygbag command; for some reason that works

The OOP Plan ("and I OOP!"):
* Master Game class with 3 Mini Game
    * std color vars: red, green, yellow, cyan, purple, cyan, magenta, orange, turquoise, white, black
*   run function that can be called during a hub interaction (open window, start etc.) (make a sub-loop)
*   automatically start on the first key input maybe? (or a title screen)
*   game over screen where you can play again or exit back to the hub
*   high score attribute
* Render class (one obj, passed into each game instance)
* var guidelines: class names in PascalCase, everything else in snake_case
